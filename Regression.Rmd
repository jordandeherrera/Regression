The Relationship between Transmission Type and Miles per Gallon
========================================================

For this analysis, we will look at the the publicly available Motor Trends set of data in R called mtcars.  We will then use graphical exploratory data analysis and regression to determine if there is a relationship between the type of transmission in a car and the car's miles per gallon fuel efficiency.

The analysis is organized into the following sections:
1.  

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
